By default, no data source instance is configured, so this is blank,click **+Add instance**, add a new ClickHouse instance as datasource.

datasource config like that
> clickhouse://username:password@host1:9000,host2:9000/database?dial_timeout=200ms&max_execution_time=60

After configuring the `dev-clickhouse` data source, it can be used in the log query page later.
